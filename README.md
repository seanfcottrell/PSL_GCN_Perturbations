# BioMarker Identification via PSL Perturbations of Gene Coexpression Networks
This repository contains the code for constructing Gene Coexpression Networks, conducting topological perturbations of said networks, analyzing the topological significance of each gene via Persistent Sheaf Laplacian Spectrum analysis, and then extracting the consistently significant genes throughout a filtration.
